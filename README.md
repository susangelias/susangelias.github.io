## Features

####* Spoken Guides are eyes and hands-free instructions.  A guide will speak the first instruction then listen for your verbal command of "Next" before speaking the next instruction.  Spoken Guides will also respond to the commands of "Repeat" or "Go Back", allowing movement through a set of instructions with verbal commands.

####* Create your own guides for private use or share them with the Spoken Guide community.  Easy guide creation via keyboard or microphone with the option to add photos to each step.

####* Guides can be categorized by type or filtered to show your private guides or all shared guides.

####* The speaking voice can be modified by pitch, rate and volume.
